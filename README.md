# Node Flow Starter

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/rust-lang/rust.svg?style=for-the-badge)]() [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm.svg?style=for-the-badge)]() [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://standardjs.com)

## Description

This is a starter project for Node libraries. I'm kind of tired of doing the same setup over and over, so I figured I'd put this out there so that I can clone it when I start a new project.

## Setup 

Just clone this project

```
git clone https://github.com/watzon/node-flow-starter.git
```

and make changes. There are a number of scripts available in `package.json` for building the flow javascript with babel, versioning and creating a CHANGELOG, running tests with Jest, and checking code style with standard.
